# Cake-Sample

This is a simple repository with a pointless C# solution that illustrates
how to use [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/), [GitVersion](https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[xUnit.NET](http://xunit.github.io/), [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover),
[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/), [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) and
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/) in an automated continuous integration cycle.

Everyone's build process will be unique, but this might be a starting place for some.
I use it to play around with the pieces and get them working before making changes
in my other projects.
